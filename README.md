# Killtime
Welcome to Killtime

Enter a world where the boundaries of magic and technology collapse, where ancient forces collide with the rush of progress, and where the ticking clock holds more than just the passage of time.

Killtime takes you on a thrilling journey alongside Lucas, Mina, and their allies as they navigate a universe on the brink of chaos. In a world fractured by political intrigue, shifting allegiances, and dark secrets, they must uncover the truth about their powers, confront forgotten legacies, and survive a web of danger that threatens to destroy everything they’ve known.

From the bustling streets of Kingston to the icy peaks of the Dwarven Mountains, and beyond, the stakes couldn’t be higher. As time runs out, their choices will shape the fate of their world—if they can stay ahead of those who would use them as pawns in a game they don’t fully understand.

Are you ready to explore a world where every second counts?

Welcome to Killtime—the clock is ticking.
