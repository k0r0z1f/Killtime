        <div class="section-content" id="birth-year">
            <h2>Birth Year</h2>
            <p>The Disciple of Earth’s birth year remains a mystery, even to those within the Empire. It is speculated that he was created for the sole purpose of serving the Empire’s destructive will.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="role-background">
            <h2>Role/Background</h2>
            <p>The Disciple of Earth serves as a harbinger of destruction, an agent sent to decimate cities and break the will of civilizations. His existence is tied to the Empire's military might, his very presence heralding ruin.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="personality-traits">
            <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
            <p>Cold, detached, and cryptic, the Disciple is a relentless force driven by an unyielding desire for dominance. His personality is shaped by a singular focus on his mission: destruction and control.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="abilities-magic">
            <h2>Abilities/Magic</h2>
            <p>His abilities center around earth manipulation: controlling stone, rock, and magma, summoning massive formations of stone, and even cracking the earth beneath him. His immense strength, coupled with regenerative armor, makes him nearly unstoppable, though he is vulnerable to intense heat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="alliances-clans">
            <h2>Alliances/Clans/Factions</h2>
            <p>He is a loyal servant of the Empire, a force of nature created to enforce the will of his masters. His allegiance lies solely with the Empire, to the point of forsaking his individuality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>The Disciple stands at 10 feet tall, his body a rocky, humanoid form with veins of glowing magma. His molten eyes glow with an inner fire, and his sheer size and form intimidate all who meet him.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="character-arc">
            <h2>Character Arc/Goal</h2>
            <p>His primary goal is to destroy the city of Brum'karoth, acquire a powerful weapon that can overthrow the Empire, and force the people to submit. He struggles with his vulnerability to thermal shock and seeks ways to overcome this weakness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="secret">
            <h2>Secret</h2>
            <p>He harbors knowledge of an ancient weapon hidden within Brum'karoth, a relic that could shift the balance of power. He also knows of powerful artifacts within the dwarven city, but their full nature remains a mystery to him.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="combat-training">
            <h2>Combat Training</h2>
            <p>Though the Disciple has no formal training, his natural abilities make him an unmatched force in combat. He adapts his tactics on the fly, learning to exploit opponents' weaknesses, including his own vulnerability to thermal shock.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="inventory">
            <h2>Inventory</h2>
            <p>His body is his weapon. He summons stone shields, boulders, and weapons directly from the earth itself. Dust and debris constantly surround him as he wreaks havoc, with his core’s damage potentially leading to explosive destruction upon his death.</p>
