        <!-- Detailed Breakdown -->
        <div class="section-content" id="population">
            <h2>Population</h2>
            <p>Members of the Resistance, working covertly to oppose the Empire's increasing control over the city of Atraxia. The group is a mixture of various individuals, including fighters, spies, and those who have lost loved ones to the Empire's rule.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>The Resistance base is hidden deep within the city, concealed by layers of old stonework and an intricate network of underground tunnels. The entrance is well-guarded, blending seamlessly into the surroundings to avoid detection by the Empire.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="energy-atmosphere">
            <h2>Energy & Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>The atmosphere is heavy with urgency and secrecy. A constant undercurrent of tension permeates the air as the group prepares for the Empire's next move. There’s a sense of cautious hope, though the pressure from the Empire is ever-growing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="architecture">
            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>The base’s architecture is a mix of ancient stonework from the old city and a labyrinthine network of tunnels that make up the heart of the Resistance’s operations. Secret chambers and hidden passages are scattered throughout, allowing members to move unseen.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="symbolism">
            <h2>Symbolism & Carvings</h2>
            <p>The Resistance has adopted tribal symbols interwoven with Imperial motifs, representing their struggle against the Empire. These symbols are carved into the stonework of the base, serving as reminders of the group's heritage and the conflict they face.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="defenses">
            <h2>Defenses</h2>
            <p>The Resistance relies on guerrilla tactics and secretive entrances to safeguard the base. Only those who know the right paths are able to find it, and its members are skilled in combat and stealth, prepared for any attack from the Empire.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="legends">
            <h2>Legends & Lore</h2>
            <p>There is a prophecy among the Resistance, one that ties Lucas' arrival to a greater destiny for the group. This prophecy speaks of a pivotal moment in the war, where Lucas' role will become clear in the struggle against the Empire.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="hidden-dangers">
            <h2>Hidden Dangers</h2>
            <p>The Empire's tightening grip over Atraxia creates constant danger. Their forces are becoming more aggressive, and time is running out for the Resistance to act. Every move must be calculated to avoid detection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="link-party">
            <h2>Link to the Party</h2>
            <p>The Resistance base serves as a safe haven for the group, with their mission now aligned with the Resistance’s cause. The group’s involvement could be the tipping point in the war against the Empire.</p>

        <div class="section-content" id="terrain">
            <h2>Surrounding Terrain</h2>

        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="weather">
            <h2>Weather</h2>
            <p>Located underground, the weather around the Resistance base is irrelevant. The air is damp and stale, with little natural light, contributing to the feeling of being trapped in a subterranean world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="recent-developments">
            <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
