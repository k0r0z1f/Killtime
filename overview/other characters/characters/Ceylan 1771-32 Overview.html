        <div class="section-content" id="birth-year">
            <h2>Birth Year</h2>
            <p>No birth year is provided for Ceylan.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="role-background">
            <h2>Role/Background</h2>
            <p>Ceylan is the mentor to Candice, residing in a secluded cave on The Watcher mountain. Once the helper and mentor figure, he is now a frail, mysterious presence. He trained Candice and was an old prophet known for a past sacrifice. His legacy is recalled by his firepit and his cryptic riddles about cycles, fate, sleeping names, and watching tombs. His cave bears his name, and he is remembered as a powerful figure whose gift continues to impact the group. He left the mansion for those who would come, serving as a benefactor and creator.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="personality-traits">
            <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
            <p>Ceylan is characterized by his eccentricity and wisdom, deeply connected to the land. He is quiet and contemplative, with a rare urgency that surfaces in cryptic moments. His personality also reflects manipulative tendencies, forgetfulness, and reclusiveness, compounded by mental deterioration that renders him fragmented, broken, distant, and ultimately mysterious.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="abilities-magic">
            <h2>Abilities/Magic</h2>
            <p>Ceylan possesses spiritual ties to The Watcher, hinting at an ancient and greater power. Although subtle, this connection underscores a mystical aspect to his abilities beyond the physical realm.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="alliances">
            <h2>Alliances/Clans/Factions</h2>
            <p>He is affiliated with the Nythari Tribe, and his influence is intimately connected to the domain of his cave. This alliance reflects his deep-rooted ties to both nature and mysticism.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Ceylan appears as an aged, weathered old man with a long white beard and unkempt hair. He wears a thick fur-lined cloak and his overall appearance is one of weariness: frail, shrunken, with bloodshot, piercing eyes, and a vacant expression as he sits and rocks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="character-arc">
            <h2>Character Arc/Goal</h2>
            <p>Ceylan’s primary role is to guide Candice on her mission to find the Children of Hybris and protect the world. His past sacrifice looms large over his fate, and his deteriorating state hints at deeper mysteries that the group must unravel. His disappearance, often noted simply as "Ceylan’s gone," adds to the enigmatic nature of his legacy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="secret">
            <h2>Secret</h2>
            <p>Behind his enigmatic presence, Ceylan harbors a secret. He suspects the rise of the Empire and its Champion, and he possesses dark knowledge regarding the prophecy. He also implies that Lucas and Mina “touched something,” hinting at hidden interactions and influences that remain shrouded in mystery.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="combat-training">
            <h2>Combat Training</h2>
            <p>Although not heavily combat-trained, Ceylan relies on his spiritual and mystical abilities. His approach to conflict is rooted in these deep, non-traditional skills rather than conventional martial prowess.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="inventory">
            <h2>Inventory</h2>
            <p>The only inventory item mentioned for Ceylan is his thick, fur-lined cloak, which underscores his minimalistic approach to material possessions and his reliance on spiritual strength.</p>
