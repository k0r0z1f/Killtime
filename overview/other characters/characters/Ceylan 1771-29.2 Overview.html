        <!-- Detailed Breakdown -->
        <div class="section-content" id="character">
            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>
                Ceylan is a mentor figure, known for his deep connection to the mystical forces of The Watcher. 
                He rarely emerges from his isolated lifestyle, and most who seek his guidance must journey to him.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="birth-year">
            <h2>Birth Year</h2>
            <p>
                The exact year of Ceylan's birth is unknown. His advanced age and the weathered lines on his face 
                suggest that he has long outlived most men of his era.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="role-background">
            <h2>Role/Background</h2>
            <p>
                As a mentor to Candice, Ceylan resides in a secluded cave on The Watcher mountain. He passes on his 
                spiritual wisdom to guide her in uncovering the truth about the Children of Hybris, an elusive group 
                he believes holds the key to the world’s protection.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="personality-traits">
            <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
            <p>
                Ceylan is eccentric and deeply wise. He is quiet and contemplative, speaking only when necessary. 
                At times, he displays a rare sense of urgency, and his cryptic advice can be both enlightening and 
                confusing. He has a tendency to manipulate situations to suit his perceived greater good, and he 
                occasionally forgets crucial details due to his declining mental state. His reclusive nature 
                underscores a life spent in solitude.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="abilities-magic">
            <h2>Abilities/Magic</h2>
            <p>
                He possesses spiritual ties to The Watcher, channeling its energy to perform unique rituals or 
                gain insights. Though these connections grant him unusual knowledge, they do not translate into 
                traditional combat prowess.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="alliances">
            <h2>Alliances/Clans/Factions</h2>
            <p>
                Ceylan’s primary allegiance lies with the Nythari Tribe. Though his seclusion has distanced him 
                from many tribe members, he is still recognized as one who once held authority and respect among them.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
                Ceylan is an aged, weathered man with a long, unkempt beard. His eyes reflect a lifetime of 
                knowledge and sacrifice. Dressed in worn robes and leaning on a simple staff, he looks every bit 
                the hermit sage one might expect to find on an isolated mountaintop.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="character-arc">
            <h2>Character Arc/Goal</h2>
            <p>
                Ceylan's overarching goal is to guide Candice on her journey to find the Children of Hybris and 
                safeguard the world from impending threats. He believes the prophecy of The Watcher indicates 
                a growing darkness and that only Candice’s success can thwart the rise of catastrophic forces.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="secret">
            <h2>Secret</h2>
            <p>
                Ceylan suspects the Empire’s ascension, along with its chosen Champion. He hints that a dark 
                prophecy foretells a devastating chain of events. The weight of this knowledge—and the spiritual 
                sacrifice he once made—have eroded his mind. His visions are increasingly clouded and his health 
                deteriorates, foreshadowing his eventual death before the conflict truly unfolds.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="combat-training">
            <h2>Combat Training</h2>
            <p>
                Ceylan is not a warrior. He relies almost entirely on mystical insight and spiritual communion 
                with The Watcher to navigate conflicts. Although he can defend himself with basic spells or 
                subtle manipulations, he avoids direct confrontation whenever possible.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="inventory">
            <h2>Inventory</h2>
            <p>
                No notable inventory is listed for Ceylan. His primary “possessions” are his worn garments, 
                a simple staff, and the intangible knowledge he carries.
            </p>
