        <!-- Detailed Breakdown -->
        <div class="section-content" id="nature">
            <h2>Nature of the Relics</h2>
            <p>The Relics are a race of ultra-advanced synthetic lifeforms created to serve the Children of Hybris. They are located at the center of the Empire's galactic territory, in a vulnerable position as they are not well-defended. The Relics' creation was meant to balance and eventually enhance the powers of Lucas, Mina, and Thomas from another timeline.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="purpose">
            <h2>Purpose of the Relics</h2>
            <p>The Relics were designed to balance and enhance the powers and mental states of the Children of Hybris. Infused with knowledge from an ancient synthetic race, the Relics' primary role is to support the Children of Hybris in fulfilling the prophecy tied to their fate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="activation">
            <h2>Activation and Behavior</h2>
            <p>The Relics are dormant until activated. Once worn, they enter "protecting mode," where they assist their wearer. They can also become autonomous if asked by the wearer, and are capable of shape-shifting up to 2.5 meters square. The wearer retains full control, as the Relics serve their will.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="glitch">
            <h2>Glitch in the Relics</h2>
            <p>The Relics were never meant to be used by their current wearers. Due to a freak incident, they are experiencing a mismatch of about 0.0001%, causing strange glitches in their behavior and attunement. This misalignment is a temporary but dangerous anomaly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="syncing">
            <h2>Syncing and Resetting</h2>
            <p>The Relics cannot sync properly with their new wearers unless a "hard reset" is performed. This process involves hidden commands and is fraught with danger, as the technology required is highly advanced and not meant for general use.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="hacking">
            <h2>Hacking the Relics</h2>
            <p>Lucas has made attempts to hack the Relics in the past, though the process is incredibly risky. There is a high likelihood of physical or mental harm to the wearer, and success would require specific tech and substantial time. However, such an endeavor could lead to catastrophic consequences.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="tech">
            <h2>Tech Needed for Resetting</h2>
            <p>To reset the Relics properly, Lucas would require highly advanced technology, likely only available in the Empire or from the creators of the synthetic lifeforms. The difficulty in finding this tech makes the reset process near-impossible without external assistance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="lucas-progress">
            <h2>Lucas' Progress</h2>
            <p>Lucas has nearly succeeded in hacking the Relics but found the risks too severe. If he continues to push forward, the consequences could be catastrophic—potentially destabilizing his bond with Mina, Thomas, and the Relics. Pushing too hard could lead to irreversible damage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="risks">
            <h2>Moral and Practical Risks</h2>
            <p>Lucas’ attempts to hack the Relics present moral challenges. The potential harm to the wearers and the unknown dangers of tampering with such an ancient and powerful force create tensions within the group. Using the Relics recklessly could fracture their unity and complicate the already dangerous mission.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="resources">
            <h2>Quest for Resources</h2>
            <p>To reset or hack the Relics, Lucas may need rare resources that are linked to the Empire or the creators of the synthetic race. These resources could form the basis for a new quest, or Lucas might have to discover hidden knowledge or access advanced tech.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="timeline-glitch">
            <h2>Timeline Glitch Impact</h2>
            <p>The glitch in the Relics could further destabilize the party's timeline or provide insights into the mysterious anomaly affecting them. Tampering with the Relics could either exacerbate the issue or, if handled correctly, offer answers—depending on how the group chooses to act.</p>
