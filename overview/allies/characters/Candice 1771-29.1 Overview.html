        <!-- Detailed Breakdown -->
        <div class="section-content" id="birth-year">
            <h2>Birth Year</h2>
            <p>
                Candice was born in the year 1721. Currently, the date is 03-06-1771 (dd/mm/yyyy), making her
                49 years old. She has spent much of her life in the Nythari tribe and has been deeply
                involved in its traditions and missions since childhood.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="role-background">
            <h2>Role & Background</h2>
            <p>
                Candice is a member of the Nythari tribe, serving as a Nythari warrior, Seeker &amp; Messenger.
                She is an apprentice to Ceylan and was tasked with finding Lucas and Mina to bring them to
                the Watcher. Her role places her at the center of a larger plan devised by the Elven Council,
                with the prophecy guiding her steps. While she believes the Watcher’s guidance is essential,
                she remains cautious about the mission's inherent risks and the true motives of those
                involved. She also seeks to learn more about the Children of Hybris and the disciples tied
                to this prophecy. Candice has been on this mission away from her village for 33 days.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="personality-traits">
            <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
            <p>
                Candice is agile, confident, and curious. She is deeply protective of nature, determined,
                introspective, and loyal. Yet she is also torn and quietly wary, as she grapples with
                internal conflict about her mission. Under pressure, she remains composed, firm,
                and sincere. Her curiosity and openness extend to her views on the Watcher, and she holds a
                reflective, almost awe-inspired reverence for its guidance. Occasionally, she grows
                frustrated with those who dismiss the Watcher’s importance, feeling the urgency of
                her duty to see Lucas and Mina’s involvement through. She can be anxious and emotional
                when she senses the mission is in jeopardy.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="abilities-magic">
            <h2>Abilities / Magic</h2>
            <p>
                She is an expert in survival, climbing, stealth, archery, and blow darts, as well as
                short blades. There is also a chaotic presence within her—something she struggles to
                control—connected to her mentor, Ceylan, which hints at deeper magical ties. This presence
                underscores her knowledge of the Watcher and the significance of its power.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="alliances-factions">
            <h2>Alliances / Factions</h2>
            <p>
                Candice operates under the temporary protection of the Elven Council, aligning herself with
                the Watcher, and remains a loyal member of the Nythari Tribe. The tribe’s traditions and
                reverence for natural harmony heavily influence her decisions. Despite the Elven Council's
                involvement, Candice's personal loyalty to the Nythari people and the Watcher stands above
                all else.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
                Candice has an athletic build and bright amber eyes that reflect her unwavering determination.
                Her long, brown-threaded hair is emblematic of her Nythari roots, often woven in practical
                styles befitting her role as a warrior. She carries herself with a certain elegance and
                exudes a striking aura, influenced by her pride in Nythari culture and her
                accomplished skill set.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="character-arc-goal">
            <h2>Character Arc / Goal</h2>
            <p>
                Candice’s primary goal is to fulfill her mission and ensure Lucas and Mina’s return to the
                Watcher. She believes that consulting the Watcher is crucial for the mission’s success.
                Simultaneously, she wrestles with the prophecy and her part in it—she fears what it could
                demand of her, yet remains committed to seeing it through. She intends to guide the group to
                the Watcher and uncover vital truths about the Children of Hybris and the disciples. Another
                source of internal conflict is the thought of returning home after many years away—she’s
                uncertain about how that reunion might unfold.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="secret">
            <h2>Secret</h2>
            <p>
                Candice holds a deep belief in the prophecy concerning Lucas and Mina. She is convinced
                her mission is inevitably tied to it. Within her mind, she carries a chaotic presence that
                lies dormant, possibly connected directly to Ceylan. This presence is both a source of
                power and a point of tension, fueling her drive while leaving her anxious about the cost.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="combat-training">
            <h2>Combat Training</h2>
            <p>
                She has honed her survival skills, including stealth, climbing, archery, and the use of
                blow darts and short blades. Though her training is formidable, she must remain mindful of
                the chaotic force within her, which can complicate her control and judgment in high-stress
                situations.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="inventory">
            <h2>Inventory</h2>
            <p>
                Candice carries a pouch of iridescent stones, which serve as currency known as Derek’s
                currency. She has a small stone fragment from the Nythari ruins, a sarbacane (blowpipe),
                and multiple darts (four poison darts and one normal dart). Additionally, she is outfitted
                with Nythari survival gear and a special pass granted by the Elven Council, allowing her
                relative freedom of movement across the lands under their domain.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="relations">
            <h2>Relations (Lucas, Mina, Thomas, Dira)</h2>
            <p>
                Candice has known Lucas, Mina, Thomas, and Dira for only two days. As they appear to be
                the Children of Hybris, Candice trusts them—or at least feels compelled to place faith in
                them—given the prophecy. She believes Lucas and Mina’s powers confirm the importance of
                her mission. With Thomas and Dira, she remains mostly an acquaintance, but she does not
                underestimate their roles in the unfolding events. The fleeting nature of their shared
                journey is overshadowed by the significance of the prophecy, uniting them under a
                common cause.
