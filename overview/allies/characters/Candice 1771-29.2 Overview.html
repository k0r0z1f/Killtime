            <p>Candice left her village 33 days ago to embark on this mission related to the Children of Hybris. Her experiences away from home have made her introspective about her personal obligations and how they intertwine with destiny.</p>

            <p>
                Candice operates under the temporary protection of the Elven Council, is aligned with the Watcher, and belongs to the Nythari Tribe.

            <p>
                Candice’s overarching goal is to fulfill her mission: ensuring Lucas and Mina’s return to the Watcher. She believes consulting the Watcher is crucial to understanding the prophecy and safeguarding the future. However, this mission sparks her own internal conflict — she is torn between her devotion to the Nythari tribe’s path and her personal reservations about returning home.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through her journey, she hopes to uncover vital truths about the Children of Hybris and her own role in this prophecy. She stands as a guide, forging ahead even amidst growing uncertainty and danger.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="secret">
            <h2>Secret</h2>
            <p>
                Candice firmly believes in the prophecy about Lucas and Mina. There is a “chaotic presence” that lurks within her mind, possibly connected to Ceylan, which she strives to keep in check. Though it grants her unique knowledge, it also threatens to destabilize her resolve at critical moments.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="combat-training">
            <h2>Combat Training</h2>
            <p>
                Her formidable skill set includes survival tactics, climbing, stealth, archery, blow darts, and proficiency with short blades. Candice’s training within the Nythari tribe has shaped her into a resourceful and disciplined warrior, capable of navigating hostile environments while maintaining composure.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="inventory">
            <h2>Inventory</h2>
            <p>
                Candice carries a pouch of iridescent stones (used as currency in Derek’s region), a small stone fragment from Nythari ruins, a sarbacane with four poison darts and one normal dart, essential Nythari survival gear, and a special pass granted by the Elven Council. These items highlight her preparedness for both diplomatic and dangerous encounters.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="lucas">
            <h2>Lucas</h2>
            <p>
                Candice has known Lucas for only 2 days. She regards him as a Child of Hybris who has already demonstrated remarkable powers. Her trust in him, while somewhat quick, stems from her belief in the prophecy and her experiences witnessing his abilities in the short time they have traveled together.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="mina">
            <h2>Mina</h2>
            <p>
                Candice’s relationship with Mina mirrors that with Lucas: they have been acquainted for 2 days and Candice views Mina as another Child of Hybris crucial to the prophecy. Despite the short time, Candice places significant faith in Mina’s role and capabilities, trusting her instincts about Mina's importance.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="thomas">
            <h2>Thomas</h2>
            <p>
                Thomas has also been part of Candice’s company for 2 days. She respects his protective nature and his strategic approach to challenges. While not a Child of Hybris, Thomas’s presence provides a stabilizing force for the group, something Candice acknowledges and values.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="dira">
            <h2>Dira</h2>
            <p>
                Another recent acquaintance, Dira has traveled alongside Candice for 2 days. Candice is keenly aware of Dira’s caution and her pursuit of redemption. While they share no long history, Candice senses that Dira’s intentions could align with the prophecy, and thus treats her with measured trust.
