            <p>Dira was born in 1739, a time when the Cult of the Sent Ones had begun to grow in influence. Her early life was shaped by the teachings of this mysterious cult, though she would later come to struggle with her own beliefs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="role-background">
            <h2>Role/Background</h2>
            <p>Dira is a devoted member of the Cult of the Sent Ones, though her past is filled with secrets.

            <p>Dira’s personality is defined by her internal conflict and anxiety. She is often <strong>nervous</strong> and <strong>secretive</strong>, carefully hiding her true thoughts and feelings.

        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="abilities-magic">
            <h2>Abilities/Magic</h2>
            <p>Dira does not possess any magical abilities. Her role in the story is more about navigating the complex political and spiritual landscape surrounding the Cult of the Sent Ones and her own guilt over past choices.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="alliances">
            <h2>Alliances/Clans/Factions</h2>
            <p>Dira is primarily aligned with the <strong>Cult of the Sent Ones</strong>, though her past ties to the Cult of the Unbound make her an outsider within her current faction. She feels conflicted about her loyalty to the Sent Ones, especially as their future becomes uncertain.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Dira is a female dwarf with a long, dark braid of hair that gives her an air of somber gravity. Her braided hair is often neat but reflects her anxious nature.

        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="character-arc">
            <h2>Character Arc/Goal</h2>
            <p>Dira's arc is driven by her fear of the Cult's eventual collapse and her desire to protect the interests of the group, even as she tries to distance herself from the Unbound. Her role becomes clearer as she struggles with her guilt and guilt-driven actions. When the Disciple goes on a rampage, Dira faces the challenge of re-evaluating her role in the conflict. This may push her to take more active steps to secure her place and protect those she has come to care for.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="secret">
            <h2>Secret</h2>
            <p>Dira has been hiding key information about the true nature of the temple and the Cult’s influence.
