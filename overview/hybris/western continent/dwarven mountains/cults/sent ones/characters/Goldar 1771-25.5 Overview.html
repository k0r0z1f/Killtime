            <ul>
                <li>He is <strong>commanding</strong> and <strong>authoritative</strong>, having led the Cult of the Sent Ones with an iron fist before his imprisonment.</li>
                <li>Goldar is <strong>insightful</strong>, with deep spiritual knowledge and understanding of the world’s ancient forces.</li>
                <li>Though often <strong>calm</strong> and <strong>deliberate</strong> in his decisions, there is an <strong>underlying tension</strong> in his demeanor, especially following his trial and fall from power.</li>

            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="abilities-magic">
            <h2>Abilities/Magic</h2>
            <p>Goldar possesses <strong>spiritual influence</strong> and has access to <strong>ancient knowledge</strong> passed down through the ages, particularly related to the Cult of the Sent Ones. These abilities allow him to guide and manipulate spiritual forces, though much of his power is diminished since his fall from grace.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="alliances">
            <h2>Alliances/Clans/Factions</h2>
            <p>Goldar remains tied to the <strong>Cult of the Sent Ones</strong>, although his once-commanding position has been undermined by recent events. His influence is now limited, but the cult’s loyalty to him is still significant, though fractured.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Goldar is a <strong>male dwarf</strong> with a <strong>tall, imposing presence</strong>. His long, white beard and intricate robes of gold and black once marked him as a leader of great stature. However, after his fall from power, he now wears a plain tunic, his ceremonial robes stripped away. His <strong>shackled hands</strong> reflect his current state of imprisonment and helplessness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="character-arc">
            <h2>Character Arc/Goal</h2>
            <p>Goldar’s arc is one of <strong>falling from power</strong> and attempting to <strong>redeem his failures</strong>. As his leadership over the Cult of the Sent Ones weakens, he faces the challenge of maintaining control and achieving his long-term goals. His survival depends on the manipulation of Lucas and Mina’s powers and the use of ancient artifacts, though the full extent of his plans is unclear. Ultimately, Goldar seeks to <strong>fulfill the prophecy</strong> and protect the world from a greater threat, though his methods and the price of success remain uncertain.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="secret">
            <h2>Secret</h2>
            <p>Goldar harbors a deep <strong>secret</strong>: his long-term plans may involve not only survival against the Empire but also the manipulation of Lucas and Mina to further the Cult’s purposes. He may have misjudged key members of his cult and has kept much knowledge to himself, unsure of who he can trust in his current situation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="combat-training">
            <h2>Combat Training</h2>
            <p>Details of Goldar’s combat training remain unclear. While he once commanded vast forces, his current state of imprisonment means he is unlikely to have the same physical prowess. His strength lies in his <strong>spiritual knowledge</strong> and <strong>manipulative tactics</strong>, rather than in physical combat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="inventory">
            <h2>Inventory</h2>
            <p><strong>Shackles</strong> - A symbol of his imprisonment.<br>
