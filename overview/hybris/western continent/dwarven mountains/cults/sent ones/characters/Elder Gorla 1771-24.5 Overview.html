        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="role-background">
            <h2>Role/Background</h2>
            <p>Gorla is a prominent council member of the <strong>Cult of the Sent Ones</strong>, a position that grants her significant influence within the organization. As an elder, she holds vast knowledge and is a respected figure, though her true motivations may not always align with the interests of the cult’s leaders.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="personality-traits">
            <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
            <p>Gorla's personality is marked by a blend of wisdom and determination:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>She is <strong>observant</strong>, always watching and listening, gathering information that can be used to further her goals.</li>
                <li>Gorla is <strong>wise</strong>, having lived for centuries and accumulated vast knowledge of both the world and the Cult.</li>
                <li>Her determination is clear in her quiet but firm pursuit of her hidden objectives, especially concerning Mina's powers.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="abilities-magic">
            <h2>Abilities/Magic</h2>
            <p>While Gorla may not possess overt magical abilities, her influence within the cult and her keen intellect make her a powerful figure. It is possible that she has access to knowledge or relics that augment her abilities, but these remain unspecified.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="alliances">
            <h2>Alliances/Clans/Factions</h2>
            <p>Gorla's primary allegiance lies with the <strong>Cult of the Sent Ones</strong>, where she serves as an elder with significant authority. Her actions may sometimes seem aligned with the cult's broader goals, but she likely has her own agenda when it comes to Mina.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>As a dwarf, Gorla's stature is short and stout. She has long, silver hair and a matching beard, which she wears with pride. Her ceremonial armor and robes give her a distinguished, almost regal appearance, befitting her status as a council member within the Cult of the Sent Ones.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="character-arc">
            <h2>Character Arc/Goal</h2>
            <p>Gorla is deeply interested in the mysterious powers Mina possesses. While she maintains her official duties as a member of the council, her secret motivations suggest that she may be looking for ways to use Mina’s abilities to further the Cult’s goals—or perhaps her own.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="secret">
            <h2>Secret</h2>
            <p>Gorla is suspicious that there is more to Mina’s powers than what has been revealed. She is quietly investigating ways to exploit these abilities for the benefit of the Cult of the Sent Ones, possibly without the full knowledge or consent of her fellow council members. Her hidden agenda remains a central mystery in her character arc.</p>
