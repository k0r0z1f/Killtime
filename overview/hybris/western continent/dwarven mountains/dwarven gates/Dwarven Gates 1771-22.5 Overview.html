        <!-- Detailed Breakdown -->
        <div class="section-content" id="setting">
            <h2>Setting</h2>
            <p>The Dwarven Gates are located in a remote, harsh region on a plateau, surrounded by rugged mountains and cold, unforgiving weather. The settlements in this area are small and isolated, primarily focused on survival and trade.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="terrain">
            <h2>Terrain</h2>
            <p>The terrain surrounding the Dwarven Gates is rugged and treacherous, with steep cliffs, rocky outcrops, and snow-covered peaks. The land is mostly barren, with little vegetation aside from hardy shrubs and grasses. The region is flanked by plains that lead up to the forests surrounding the gates.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="climate">
            <h2>Climate</h2>
            <p>The climate is extremely cold, with fluctuating temperatures that make the plateau inhospitable at times. Snowstorms and windstorms are common, making travel difficult and dangerous. The area is plagued by long winters and brief, harsh summers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="architecture">
            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>The architecture of the region is deeply influenced by the dwarves' need for defense and survival. Most buildings are carved directly into the rock, offering protection from the cold and the elements. The settlements are often subterranean, with tunnels, caves, and strongholds that are strategically designed to withstand attacks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="dwarven-culture">
            <h2>Dwarven Culture</h2>
            <p>Dwarven culture places great emphasis on craftsmanship, resilience, and self-sufficiency. The dwarves are known for their skill in mining, smithing, and engineering. They hold a deep respect for tradition, and their society is built around the values of hard work and perseverance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="key-settlements">
            <h2>Key Settlements</h2>
            <p>- <strong>Stonefall</strong>: The main settlement before the Dwarven Gates. Stonefall is a bustling village where trade and mining are the primary activities. <br> - <strong>Frostguard</strong>: A smaller outpost located on the edge of the plateau. Known for its formidable defenses and strategic importance, it serves as the first line of defense against threats.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="resources">
            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <p>The region is rich in natural resources, particularly minerals, precious metals, and gems, which are mined by the dwarves. These resources are the backbone of the dwarven economy, though mining in the region is dangerous due to the harsh climate and rocky terrain.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="trade-economy">
            <h2>Trade & Economy</h2>
            <p>The dwarven settlements primarily trade in metal goods, gemstones, and finely crafted items. Although the region is self-reliant, there are occasional trade agreements with outsiders for essential supplies, such as food and rare materials.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="defenses">
            <h2>Defenses</h2>
            <p>The dwarven settlements are heavily fortified with thick stone walls, guard posts, watchtowers, and traps to protect against invaders. The most fortified of these settlements are located near the Dwarven Gates, which serve as the last line of defense before the kingdom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="local-creatures">
            <h2>Local Creatures</h2>
            <p>The region is home to dangerous wildlife, including mountain predators such as snow leopards and mythical creatures like ice elementals. Bandit groups also inhabit the area, preying on travelers and settlers alike.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="dwarven-gates">
            <h2>Dwarven Gates</h2>
            <p>The Dwarven Gates themselves are massive stone structures, intricately carved with ancient runes and symbols. They are the entry point to the Dwarven Kingdom, a towering testament to dwarven engineering and craftsmanship. The gates are said to be enchanted, only opening to those deemed worthy by the dwarves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="climate-challenges">
            <h2>Climate Challenges</h2>
            <p>The extreme cold, heavy snow, and fierce winds pose significant challenges for travelers and settlers. Frostbite, hypothermia, and other cold-related injuries are frequent, and only the most prepared can endure the harsh conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="additional-features">
            <h2>Additional Features</h2>
            <p>Hidden beneath the city of Brum'korath lies a secret route within the undercity sewers. This passage leads deeper into the kingdom, its existence known only to a select few. Cryptic messages suggest that the "Sent Ones" may play a role in unlocking the secrets of this path.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="recent-events">
            <h2>Recent Events</h2>
            <p>Recently, Lucas and his group rescued Thrain Ironfoot, a dwarven merchant, from a group of bandits. Thrain, in gratitude, has offered to guide them through the mountains, helping them navigate the treacherous terrain. The group's journey has focused on survival, trust, and the dangers of the plateau.</p>
