        <!-- Detailed Breakdown -->
        <div class="section-content" id="birth-year">
            <h2>Birth Year</h2>
            <p>The records do not provide a birth year for Ceylan, leaving his exact age and origins shrouded in mystery.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="role-background">
            <h2>Role/Background</h2>
            <p>Ceylan once served as a helper and mentor figure, known for his wisdom and guidance. Over time, he has become a frail and enigmatic presence residing in a cave. As a trainer of Candice, he carries the weight of his past as an old prophet who made a significant sacrifice, a decision that still haunts his existence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="personality-traits">
            <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
            <p>He is characterized by a blend of wisdom and fragility. His personality is marked by mysteriousness and a fragmented, cryptic nature. Despite his evident frailty and broken demeanor, there is an undeniable depth in his distant and vacant outlook.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="abilities-magic">
            <h2>Abilities/Magic</h2>
            <p>Ceylan exhibits hints of an ancient and greater power, suggesting that his abilities may extend beyond the realm of ordinary understanding. However, the specifics remain elusive and shrouded in ambiguity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="alliances">
            <h2>Alliances/Clans/Factions</h2>
            <p>He is intricately connected to the cave’s domain—a force and environment that seems to be an extension of his own existence rather than a personal affiliation. This connection hints at a deeper, mystical bond with the land.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Ceylan is depicted with a long white beard and unkempt hair, symbolizing his age and the passage of time. He wears a thick fur-lined cloak that serves both as protection and as a marker of his enigmatic persona. His physical appearance—worn, frail, and shrunken—along with bloodshot, piercing eyes, contributes to an overall impression of a man who has seen much and carries deep, unspoken burdens.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="character-arc">
            <h2>Character Arc/Goal</h2>
            <p>The deterioration of Ceylan’s physical state hints at a profound internal mystery. His past sacrifice is a lingering presence that not only defines his existence but also challenges the group he supports. His journey suggests that unraveling his past may be key to understanding and resolving the larger enigmas that confront them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="secret">
            <h2>Secret</h2>
            <p>There is a subtle, unsettling implication that when Lucas and Mina encountered an unknown force, it affected Ceylan in such a way that his state could be described as "already dead." This secret adds a layer of darkness and intrigue to his character, suggesting that his fate is intertwined with mysterious, possibly supernatural events.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="combat-training">
            <h2>Combat Training</h2>
            <p>No formal combat training has been detailed for Ceylan, emphasizing his role as a mentor and a keeper of ancient knowledge rather than a fighter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="inventory">
            <h2>Inventory</h2>
            <p>The only item noted in Ceylan’s inventory is his thick, fur-lined cloak. This garment is emblematic of his character, serving as both a protective layer and a visual representation of his storied past.</p>
