            <p>Ceylan serves as a mentor to Candice, residing in a secluded cave on The Watcher mountain. Once recognized as a reliable helper and mentor figure, he has now become a frail and mysterious presence. His role extends beyond mere mentorship as he is known as an old prophet who once made a significant sacrifice, adding layers of depth and complexity to his character.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="personality-traits">

            <p>Ceylan is both eccentric and wise, possessing a deep connection to the land. He maintains a quiet, contemplative demeanor with occasional bursts of urgency. However, his personality is also marked by a cryptic and manipulative nature, combined with forgetfulness and reclusiveness. Over time, his mental state has deteriorated, leaving him fragmented, broken, distant, and often appearing vacant.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="abilities-magic">
            <h2>Abilities/Magic</h2>

There is an underlying hint of an ancient, greater power within him that connects him to the mystical forces of the land.

        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="alliances">
            <h2>Alliances/Clans/Factions</h2>

        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Ceylan is depicted as an aged, weathered man with a long white beard and unkempt hair. His attire is dominated by a thick, fur-lined cloak that speaks to his rugged and secluded life. His appearance is notably worn and frail, with a shrunken stature and bloodshot, piercing eyes. Often seen sitting and rocking, his vacant expression adds to the aura of mystery that surrounds him.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="character-arc">
            <h2>Character Arc/Goal</h2>
            <p>The core of Ceylan’s journey lies in his mission to guide Candice on her quest to locate the Children of Hybris and ultimately protect the world. His deteriorating physical and mental condition hints at a deeper, unresolved mystery. Additionally, the shadow of his past sacrifice looms large, suggesting that his role is pivotal not just as a mentor but as a catalyst for change, redemption, and deeper understanding within the unfolding narrative.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="secret">
            <h2>Secret</h2>

This secret underscores the profound and mysterious forces at play within his world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="combat-training">
            <h2>Combat Training</h2>
            <p>Ceylan is not trained in conventional combat. Instead, he relies on his spiritual and mystical abilities, which align more with ancient magic and a deep connection to the forces of nature rather than physical fighting skills.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="inventory">
            <h2>Inventory</h2>
            <p>The most notable item in Ceylan’s possession is his thick, fur-lined cloak. This garment not only provides physical warmth but also symbolizes his connection to the wild and mystical aspects of his environment.</p>
