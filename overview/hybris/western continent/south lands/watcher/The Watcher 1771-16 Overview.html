        <!-- Detailed Breakdown -->
        <div class="section-content" id="population">
            <h2>Population</h2>
            <p>The Watcher is home to the Nythari tribe, a small, isolated elven community. It also hosts Ceylan, an old man who resides in a cave high in the mountains, serving as the tribe's guardian or spiritual guide.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>The Watcher is a jagged, solitary mountain peak that rises dramatically above the lush jungles and valleys below. Its slopes are steep and rugged, and its upper region is barren and exposed, offering little cover or vegetation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="energy-atmosphere">
            <h2>Energy & Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>The atmosphere is quiet and reverent, imbued with an ancient and spiritual energy. The land feels timeless, with an undercurrent of deep connection to the natural and supernatural world around it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="architecture">
            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>The Nythari live in small, scattered villages along the mountain's base, with primitive huts constructed from natural materials. Caves also serve as homes or sacred spaces for the tribe, blending seamlessly with the harsh landscape.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="symbolism">
            <h2>Symbolism & Carvings</h2>
            <p>The Nythari tribe views the mountain as a spirit guardian. Warriors wear mountain hawk brooches, symbolizing their bond with the guardian spirit. Carvings and totems are scattered throughout the mountain, honoring this spiritual connection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="defenses">
            <h2>Defenses</h2>
            <p>The mountain's steep and rugged terrain serves as its primary defense, making it difficult for outsiders to access. Natural obstacles, combined with the tribal knowledge of the land, make the region almost impenetrable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="legends">
            <h2>Legends & Lore</h2>
            <p>According to Nythari tradition, the mountain is not just a natural landmark but a spiritual guardian. Those who understand its secrets are allowed to approach, while others are kept away. The tribe holds ancient knowledge about the mountain’s true nature.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="hidden-dangers">
            <h2>Hidden Dangers</h2>
            <p>There are whispered rumors of arcane threats in the area, possibly linked to the Empire's growing interest in the region. Ceylan has warned of these dangers, though the full extent remains unknown. The mountain itself may hide ancient powers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="link-party">
            <h2>Link to the Party</h2>
            <p>The party’s journey is tied to Candice’s mission to find the children of Hybris, and the secrets held by the Watcher may hold the key to understanding the children’s significance or unlocking hidden powers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="terrain">
            <h2>Surrounding Terrain</h2>
            <p>The terrain surrounding the Watcher consists of dense jungles, winding rivers, and steep valleys. The mountain itself dominates the landscape, rising high above the surrounding wilderness and casting a long shadow across the land.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="weather">
            <h2>Weather</h2>
            <p>The area is often shrouded in morning mist, with an occasional east wind that sweeps across the mountain. The weather is mostly clear, and on crisp days, the sea can be seen in the distance beyond the jungle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="recent-developments">
            <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
            <p>Recently, tensions have risen in Kingston due to an explosion that may be linked to arcane forces. Ceylan believes the Empire is involved, and these developments may spell trouble for the Watcher and its guardians.</p>
