        <!-- Detailed Breakdown -->
        <div class="section-content" id="location-name">
            <h2>Location Name</h2>
            <p><strong>The Watcher</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="population">
            <h2>Population</h2>
            <p>Nythari Tribe (a small, isolated elven community), Ceylan (an old man residing in a cave high in the mountain), a few reclusive guardians and worshipers, minimal wildlife, adventuring group.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>A majestic and imposing sentinel mountain with jagged cliffs, treacherous paths, deep crevasses, icy overhangs, and snow-covered paths. Swirling mists, sparse vegetation at higher altitudes, a mist-shrouded peak covered in eternal snow. Surrounded by dense vegetation at its base, with hidden natural shelters like outcrops and narrow alcoves. Rugged mountain base with new layers of frost on rocks, ice settled in unstable areas, altering its appearance. Rocky, icy, and broken landscape with altered pathways leading to the Pass of the Hawk.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="energy-atmosphere">
            <h2>Energy &amp; Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>Quiet, ancient, spiritually charged, imbued with sacred energy and a mystical, watchful presence. Reverent, mysterious, with a deep foreboding tied to prophecy. Harsh and foreboding with a constant sense of danger. Filled with an unnatural stillness, tension from avalanches, and relentless winds. Lingering, faint energy hinting at the mysterious Minulican’s presence. A reactive, shifting energy felt by Aphyrosia, contributing to a heavy, uncertain atmosphere. A subtle, expectant aura—simply “there… waiting.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="architecture">
            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>Natural formations dominate the area, with hidden temples (rare), ancient ruins (rare), primitive huts, and caves shaped by ancient forces. Villages with primitive huts made from natural materials are scattered around the mountain. Shelters are improvised from natural rock outcrops, blending seamlessly into the environment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="symbolism">
            <h2>Symbolism &amp; Carvings</h2>
            <p>Cave walls and surrounding areas are adorned with Nythari-style paintings and carvings featuring ancient symbols of prophecy, worship, guardianship, and connections to elves. Sacred totems, carvings of eyes, or symbols of watching etched into rocks (often hidden in cracks). Mountain hawk brooches worn by warriors are prevalent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="defenses">
            <h2>Defenses</h2>
            <p>Naturally defended by steep, rugged terrain, difficult access paths, unstable paths, falling rocks, avalanches, sudden weather changes, and harsh conditions. Mystical traps, guarded paths, and isolation enhance its defenses. Recent tremors and increased avalanches add further challenges. Unstable, natural defenses (loose ice, shifting rocky surfaces, cracked ice, unstable paths).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="legends-lore">
            <h2>Legends &amp; Lore</h2>
            <p>The Watcher is said to be a sentinel, testing those who ascend. Legends speak of an ancient guardian spirit tied to the Nythari people and prophecy. It is revered as a living entity, spiritually connected to the land, offering wisdom through visions and trials. Linked to the Children of Hybris prophecy, symbolizing strength, resilience, guidance, and protection. Implied connection to the Minulican’s mysterious behavior; "unfinished business" is suggested.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="hidden-dangers">
            <h2>Hidden Dangers</h2>
            <p>Unstable crevices, falling rocks, avalanches, hidden traps, unpredictable gusts, mystical phenomena, and harsh weather conditions. Corruption attempts by the Empire in ancient legends. Sudden tremors, extreme cold, and supernatural threats. A tall, hairy figure observing travelers with unknown intentions. Cracked ice and unstable paths that can give way unexpectedly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="link-to-party">
            <h2>Link to the Party</h2>
            <p>The Watcher is central to uncovering the prophecy's truth and tied to the party’s mission to bring Lucas and Mina to its sacred cave. The journey is part of Candice’s mission and the Queen’s plan. The site offers wisdom through Ceylan and resilience through its legacy. The group camps near the snowed-in path of the Pass of the Hawk, dealing with illness and foreboding, while testing their unity. Serves as a reference point in the party's search for clues regarding Lucas, Mina, and the Minulican. Marks the cave entrance on their mountain climb.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="terrain">
            <h2>Surrounding Terrain</h2>
            <p>Dense jungles, rivers, and valleys at lower altitudes transitioning to rocky, steep elevations. Sheer drops, jagged cliffs, twisting paths, icy cliffs, avalanche paths, deep crevasses, and hidden trails leading to caves and temples. The eastern slope houses a temple. Direction toward the jungle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="weather">
            <h2>Weather</h2>
            <p>Base: warm, humid; Peak: cold, snowy, misty; extremely cold with biting winds. Volatile weather includes frequent storms, howling winds, occasional east winds, misty mornings, and tremors. Treacherous winds after dusk and intense avalanches occur. Cold, with fresh snow; storm has eased enough for visibility but deepened the chill. Howling wind. Heavy snowfall.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="recent-developments">
            <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
            <p>Recent tremors caused a new crevasse to open, forcing the group to find a perilous way across. An explosion in Kingston tied to arcane forces raises tensions. Increased Empire interest in corrupting the site. A severe avalanche tested the group’s unity. A strange figure has been spotted watching them. The Minulican’s energy has been detected leaving toward the east, suggesting injury or unresolved matters. Changed overnight—with new frost and a noticeable shift in the mountain’s reactive energy.</p>
