        <!-- Detailed Breakdown -->
        <div class="section-content" id="location-name">
            <h2>Location Name</h2>
            <p><strong>Ceylan's Cave</strong> is the designated name of this enigmatic location.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="population">
            <h2>Population</h2>
            <p>The cave was once home to Ceylan, who is now missing, leaving the site steeped in mystery.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>This natural cave is described as a jagged stone arch, half-covered in snow with rough, damp walls that have been mysteriously smoothed over. It permanently contained a massive, dark mahogany door with intricate details. The interior is noted for its cold, barren environment and rough, icy stone floors lacking any built features.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="energy-atmosphere">
            <h2>Energy &amp; Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>The cave exudes a layered and altered ambiance characterized by heavy, unnerving stillness. The atmosphere is oppressive, chilling, and eerily silent, with an almost tangible vibration that suggests shifting time and power. Despite these ominous traits, it was also noted as a safe starting point before a chase.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="architecture">
            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>The structure appears as a natural stone formation that is externally unmodified but internally altered by unknown forces. The most striking feature is an unexpected, ornate mahogany door that remained in place until morning, hinting at alterations beyond natural causes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="symbolism">
            <h2>Symbolism &amp; Carvings</h2>
            <p>The mahogany door is adorned with intricate, swirling carvings featuring eyes, spirals, and mysterious faceless figures. It is further embellished with ornate brass knockers shaped like watchful faces. No additional symbolism is noted elsewhere in the cave.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="defenses">
            <h2>Defenses</h2>
            <p>There are no explicit or constructed defenses present. However, the door’s self-opening nature coupled with the cave’s mysterious energy implies a mystical safeguard. The natural formation itself offers only minimal protection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="legends">
            <h2>Legends &amp; Lore</h2>
            <p>The cave is tied to the cryptic lore of Ceylan, the old man who spoke of cycles, fate, and hidden names. It is linked to prophecy and the movement on the Watcher, and is described as a place “outside of time” that carries a lingering magical presence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="hidden-dangers">
            <h2>Hidden Dangers</h2>
            <p>There are concealed, potentially dangerous forces at work within the cave. The altered energy, the mysterious stirring of the door, the disappearance of Ceylan, and the unseen presence of the Watcher, all compounded by the memory of vanished mansion comforts, hint at hidden perils.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="link-to-party">
            <h2>Link to the Party</h2>
            <p>Lucas emerged from this location before being captured by the Beast. The cave served as the starting point for Mina and others in their pursuit of Lucas, and the party later found themselves unexpectedly transitioning from a mansion to this cave as they were drawn by prophecy and the search for answers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="terrain">
            <h2>Surrounding Terrain</h2>
            <p>The cave is situated in a mountainous and icy region near jagged cliffs. It lies on a treacherous, icy mountain path that has been scarred by recent storms, with snowy surroundings and cold, howling winds.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="weather">
            <h2>Weather</h2>
            <p>The external weather around the cave is bitterly cold, marked by violent, icy storms and harsh winds. In contrast, the interior of the cave has an unnaturally warmer and heavier feel.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="recent-developments">
            <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
            <p>Prior to the encounter with the Beast, Lucas had left the cave. More recently, however, the cave has undergone a transformation: its interior has been altered, Ceylan has vanished, and a mysterious, self-opening mahogany door has appeared. Overnight, a mansion with its comforts disappeared, leaving the party with healed wounds but a lost day, ultimately forcing them toward the eastern pass to continue their mission.</p>
