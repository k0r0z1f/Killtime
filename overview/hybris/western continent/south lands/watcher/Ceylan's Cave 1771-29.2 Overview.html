        <!-- Detailed Breakdown -->
        <div class="section-content" id="population">
            <h2>Population</h2>
            <p>
                Ceylan is the sole inhabitant of this mountain cave—a spiritual guardian and 
                intermediary of the Watcher. Although referred to as a “population” of one, 
                Ceylan’s role and presence carry a significance that extends far beyond mere numbers.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
                The entrance to Ceylan's Cave is hidden by jagged rock formations and blanketed 
                in snow, rendering it difficult to spot from a distance. Inside, the cave is dimly 
                lit by natural light that filters through the narrow entrance, creating elongated 
                shadows across the uneven floor. Accessing the entrance itself requires a five to 
                six-hour climb over steep and precarious mountain paths.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="energy-atmosphere">
            <h2>Energy & Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>
                The very air within the cave seems alive with the Watcher’s presence, radiating a 
                profound sense of sacredness and heightened awareness. Every step deeper into the 
                cavern resonates with the thrumming energy of an ancient force. This place is 
                believed to be vital for unraveling the prophecy, containing wisdom that has been 
                guarded for centuries.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="architecture">
            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                Ceylan’s Cave is largely a natural formation carved out by millennia of geological 
                processes. Only minor modifications exist—slightly smoothened pathways and small, 
                level surfaces created to ensure easier navigation within the cavern. There are no 
                elaborate constructions or decorations aside from these practical adjustments, 
                leaving most of the cave’s interior in its pristine, organic state.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="symbolism">
            <h2>Symbolism & Carvings</h2>
            <p>
                Along the walls, one can find ancient carvings of mountain hawks and the distinctive 
                markings of the Nythari symbols. These represent concepts of balance, wisdom, and 
                protection—values deeply intertwined with the lore of the Nytharis. Their existence 
                within the cave underscores the cave’s long-held sanctity and its importance to 
                those seeking knowledge of the Watcher’s teachings.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="defenses">
            <h2>Defenses</h2>
            <p>
                The cave’s remote location and formidable terrain act as its primary defenses. 
                The treacherous climb, unpredictable weather, and risk of rockfalls form natural 
                barriers that deter most from venturing here. No formal fortifications are present; 
                instead, nature itself safeguards this sanctum and its secrets.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="legends">
            <h2>Legends & Lore</h2>
            <p>
                According to legend, Ceylan resides here as the spiritual guardian and intermediary 
                of the Watcher, tasked with guiding seekers of truth. The cave is said to hold 
                fragments of wisdom crucial for understanding a pivotal prophecy. Whether these 
                revelations pertain to an imminent danger or a grand destiny remains a mystery, 
                fueling both curiosity and fear among those who know of Ceylan’s existence.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="hidden-dangers">
            <h2>Hidden Dangers</h2>
            <p>
                Years of shifting tectonics have rendered the ground unstable, prone to sudden 
                rockfalls. The biting winds grow fiercer after dusk, and recent tremors have 
                increased the likelihood of avalanches. While the cave’s spiritual significance 
                draws pilgrims and adventurers, these natural perils present a constant threat 
                to all who journey here.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="link-party">
            <h2>Link to the Party</h2>
            <p>
                For the party, ascending to Ceylan’s Cave is essential. Their quest hinges on 
                acquiring the wisdom and guidance housed within these sacred walls. Consulting 
                Ceylan may provide the crucial insight they need to fulfill their prophetic journey 
                or avert disaster—making this perilous trek an unavoidable step in their adventure.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="terrain">
            <h2>Surrounding Terrain</h2>
            <p>
                The cave is nestled high in a mountainous region, marked by steep, jagged paths, 
                sparse vegetation, and looming rocky outcrops. Recent tremors have made some 
                routes unsafe, forcing travelers to find alternative paths. The unforgiving 
                environment tests the endurance and resourcefulness of anyone attempting 
                to reach the entrance.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="weather">
            <h2>Weather</h2>
            <p>
                At this altitude, the weather is cold and brisk, with swirling mist that can reduce 
                visibility. Occasional sunlight breaks through, revealing breathtaking vistas, 
                though such moments are fleeting. As night falls, the wind becomes treacherous, 
                howling through the rocky crags and further complicating any ascent or descent.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="recent-developments">
            <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
            <p>
                Recent mountain tremors have rendered the usual paths to Ceylan’s Cave more 
                precarious than ever. Avalanche activity has increased, heightening the dangers 
                for travelers. The tension around these unstable conditions adds urgency to 
                the party’s mission—if they delay, the path may become all but impassable, and the 
                prophecy could remain buried within the cave forever.
