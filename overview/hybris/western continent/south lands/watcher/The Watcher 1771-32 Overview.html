        <!-- Detailed Breakdown -->
        <div class="section-content" id="location-name">
            <h2>Location Name</h2>
            <p><strong>The Watcher</strong> is the name given to a majestic, sentinel mountain that dominates the landscape. Its very name evokes both reverence and caution among those who know its legends.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="population">
            <h2>Population</h2>
            <p>The area is home to the Nythari Tribe, a small and isolated elven community, along with Ceylan—an old man once residing in a high mountain cave, now missing. Also present are a few reclusive guardians and worshipers, sparse local wildlife, an adventuring group, and the Beast before its demise.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>The Watcher presents as a majestic and imposing sentinel mountain. It features jagged cliffs, treacherous paths, deep crevasses, icy overhangs, and snow-covered trails. The peak is cloaked in swirling mists and eternal snow, with sparse vegetation at higher altitudes, while dense flora and hidden shelters like outcrops and narrow alcoves define its base. New frost layers, unstable ice patches, and altered pathways—leading to places such as the Pass of the Hawk—accentuate its rugged beauty. Within its bounds, a cave with a massive, intricately carved mahogany door (which mysteriously disappeared by morning) adds to its enigmatic allure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="energy-atmosphere">
            <h2>Energy &amp; Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>The mountain exudes a quiet, ancient energy imbued with sacredness and mystery. There is a palpable sense of foreboding linked to ancient prophecy. Its atmosphere is marked by an almost spiritual stillness, tension from frequent avalanches, and relentless winds. Subtle energies hint at the presence of the enigmatic Minulican, while the environment’s reactive nature contributes to a heavy, uncertain aura—a reminder that something is always "there… waiting."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="architecture">
            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>Architecture here is defined by natural formations. Hidden temples and ancient ruins (though rare) punctuate the landscape along with primitive huts and caves. Villages of huts built from natural materials are scattered near the mountain's base, while improvised shelters seamlessly blend with natural rock outcrops, jagged cliffs, and overhangs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="symbolism-carvings">
            <h2>Symbolism &amp; Carvings</h2>
            <p>The cave walls and surrounding areas are adorned with Nythari-style paintings and carvings. These artworks feature ancient symbols associated with prophecy, worship, guardianship, and the elven heritage. Sacred totems, depictions of watching eyes hidden in rock cracks, and prevalent mountain hawk brooches worn by warriors contribute to the rich symbolic tapestry of the site.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="defenses">
            <h2>Defenses</h2>
            <p>The Watcher is naturally fortified by its steep, rugged terrain. Difficult access routes, unstable paths, falling rocks, and avalanches serve as formidable defenses. In addition, mystical traps and the inherent isolation of the area enhance its security. Recent tremors and increased avalanche activity further complicate access, with natural hazards such as treacherous ice, sheer drops, and hidden ravines posing constant threats.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="legends-lore">
            <h2>Legends &amp; Lore</h2>
            <p>Legends describe The Watcher as a sentient sentinel that tests those who dare ascend its heights. Revered as an ancient guardian spirit intertwined with the Nythari people and prophetic traditions, it is believed to offer wisdom through visions and trials. The site is linked to the Children of Hybris prophecy and hints at unfinished business connected to the mysterious Minulican. Ceylan’s cryptic riddles even suggest that the mountain “moves with time,” adding to its mythic allure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="hidden-dangers">
            <h2>Hidden Dangers</h2>
            <p>The mountain conceals numerous dangers: unstable crevices, falling rocks, sudden avalanches, and hidden traps. Unpredictable gusts, mystical phenomena, and harsh weather further heighten the risks. Among these perils, a tall, hairy figure has been reported observing travelers, and deceptive calm often masks the presence of concealed forces—evidenced by the mysterious door that appeared and later vanished.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="link-party">
            <h2>Link to the Party</h2>
            <p>The Watcher plays a crucial role in the unfolding prophecy. It is a central point in the party’s mission—to guide Lucas and Mina to its sacred cave. This journey forms part of Candice’s mission and aligns with the Queen’s plan. The mountain offers not only wisdom, through figures like Ceylan, but also a test of unity, as seen when the party camps near the Pass of the Hawk. Its altered state directly influences the party’s search for clues regarding Lucas, Mina, and the enigmatic Minulican.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="surrounding-terrain">
            <h2>Surrounding Terrain</h2>
            <p>The terrain surrounding The Watcher is diverse. Lower altitudes feature dense jungles, rivers, and valleys, which gradually give way to rocky, steep elevations. The landscape is punctuated by sheer drops, jagged cliffs, twisting paths, icy slopes, and deep crevasses. Hidden trails lead to additional caves and temples, with the eastern slope even hosting a temple that points toward the jungle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="weather">
            <h2>Weather</h2>
            <p>The weather at The Watcher varies dramatically. At the base, conditions are warm and humid, while the peak endures cold, snowy, and misty climates, with extremely biting winds at night. Frequent storms, howling winds, and occasional tremors create a volatile environment. Avalanches and sudden changes in weather are common, contributing to the overall treacherous nature of the mountain.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="recent-developments">
            <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
            <p>Recent events have significantly altered the landscape. Tremors have opened new crevasses, forcing adventurers to seek perilous alternative routes. An explosion in Kingston—tied to arcane forces—has raised tensions, while increased interest from the Empire hints at potential corruption of the site. A severe avalanche has tested the unity of those venturing here. Additionally, the appearance (and subsequent disappearance) of a mysterious door, along with reports of the Beast’s actions, mark The Watcher as a dynamic and ever-changing landmark.</p>
