        <!-- Detailed Breakdown -->
        <div class="section-content" id="population">
            <h2>Population</h2>
            <p>The research center is home to a dedicated group of researchers, engineers, and scientists who specialize in magi-tech. They are focused on unraveling the mysteries of ancient relics and combining magic with modern technology.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>The center’s design is sleek and futuristic, with glowing walls embedded with runes. Floating orbs of light illuminate the space, while humming machines echo through the air. The metallic sheen of the structure is contrasted by the soft glow of crystalline orbs, blending technology and tradition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="energy-atmosphere">
            <h2>Energy & Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>The atmosphere is charged with both excitement and tension. There’s a sense of eager anticipation, but also a lingering unease due to the failure of a past experiment. Researchers work with a sense of determination, but the air is thick with the weight of uncertainty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="architecture">
            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>The center features cutting-edge architecture, with large chambers housing platforms that hover with the help of arcane energy. Polished stone floors gleam beneath the sleek, futuristic consoles and energy conduits that power the space.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="symbolism">
            <h2>Symbolism & Carvings</h2>
            <p>Runic symbols glow softly along the walls, representing various arcane principles. These runes are not only decorative but also serve as a means of channeling magical energy throughout the facility. Arcane artifacts are carefully preserved and studied for their potential to unlock greater power.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="defenses">
            <h2>Defenses</h2>
            <p>Advanced magi-tech equipment and protective wards ensure the safety of the research center. Energy surges from failed experiments are contained within specially designed chambers, preventing harm to the researchers and the relics they study.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="legends">
            <h2>Legends & Lore</h2>
            <p>One of the prevailing legends in the center is the potential consciousness of the relics. It is speculated that the ancient artifacts being studied may not just be inanimate objects but possess some form of sentience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="hidden-dangers">
            <h2>Hidden Dangers</h2>
            <p>The relics remain unpredictable, with their energy capable of spiraling out of control. A slight DNA anomaly detected in the relics poses a risk to researchers, as any failure to control the relic’s energy could lead to catastrophic consequences.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="link-party">
            <h2>Link to the Party</h2>
            <p>The party plays a central role in the research at the center. Lucas, Mina, Thomas, and Dira are actively involved in understanding and activating the relics, uncovering the mysteries that could impact their world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="terrain">
            <h2>Surrounding Terrain</h2>
            <p>The research center is part of a sprawling complex of technologically advanced facilities. It is surrounded by other research centers, forming a hub of magi-tech innovation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="weather">
            <h2>Weather</h2>
            <p>The center exists indoors, with controlled, artificial lighting. There is no natural weather influence, as the environment is fully regulated to maintain ideal conditions for research.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="recent-developments">
            <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
            <p>Following the failure of an experiment involving one of the relics, researchers are now reevaluating their approach. Some hints of progress have emerged, but uncertainty looms as they continue their studies with heightened caution.</p>
