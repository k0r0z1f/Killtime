        <div class="section-content" id="population">
            <h2>Population</h2>
            <p>The population of Kingston is estimated in the millions. It is a densely packed urban center, with a mix of wealthy elites, working-class individuals, and a struggling underclass. The aftermath of the explosion has left much of the population in a state of shock, with many still struggling to recover from the event's devastating impact.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Kingston is an urban sprawl where old and new coexist. The skyline is marked by modern glass towers juxtaposed against older brick buildings, some of which show signs of damage from the explosion. The city’s scars are still visible, with damaged structures standing as reminders of the devastation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="energy-atmosphere">
            <h2>Energy & Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>The city feels heavy and tense, with the lingering trauma of the explosion hanging in the air. People move about with caution, eyes always searching for signs of danger. The destruction left in the wake of the blast has left Kingston’s atmosphere charged with fear and uncertainty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="architecture">
            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>The architecture in Kingston is a blend of modern designs and older structures. Remnants of the explosion are scattered throughout, with buildings that were once gleaming now reduced to rubble or skeletal remains. Despite the destruction, the city has continued to rebuild, albeit in an unsteady manner.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="symbolism">
            <h2>Symbolism & Carvings</h2>
            <p>Symbols of destruction and rebirth are common throughout Kingston, reflecting the city’s troubled history. The explosion that tore through the city has become a symbol of both loss and the resilience of the people who remain, continuing to rebuild in the aftermath.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="defenses">
            <h2>Defenses</h2>
            <p>Following the explosion, Kingston has implemented new defenses, including increased patrols and explosive remnants scattered across the city. While some of these defenses serve as a deterrent, they also stand as grim reminders of the catastrophe that shook the city to its core.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="legends">
            <h2>Legends & Lore</h2>
            <p>Kingston’s most enduring legend is tied to the explosion itself. Many believe the blast was no mere accident, with some suggesting it was a result of the party's involvement, particularly Lucas. The city now lives in the shadow of the event, with the explosion’s memory haunting the people’s collective consciousness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="hidden-dangers">
            <h2>Hidden Dangers</h2>
            <p>Among Kingston’s rubble, there are still dangers lurking. The central trade routes are vital to the city’s survival, but there are rumors of underground groups taking advantage of the chaos. Some believe the remnants of the explosion could be used for more destructive purposes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="link-party">
            <h2>Link to the Party</h2>
            <p>The party's actions are directly tied to the explosion in Kingston. Lucas, in particular, is deeply connected to the event, and their involvement has made them both a source of suspicion and potential hope for the city's future. The World Police has been scrutinizing them, and Kingston’s recovery is closely linked to their actions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="terrain">
            <h2>Surrounding Terrain</h2>
            <p>Kingston is located near a large body of water and central trade routes. The surrounding terrain is urban, but the waterways and routes make it an essential point of commerce, though they have also been disrupted in the aftermath of the explosion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="weather">
            <h2>Weather</h2>
            <p>Kingston’s weather is highly unstable. Frequent storms have swept through since the explosion, adding to the city’s sense of turmoil. Weather patterns have become erratic, perhaps as a reflection of the emotional state of the city’s residents.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="recent-developments">
            <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
            <p>The explosion continues to affect Kingston’s political and social landscape. The World Police are increasingly involved, and rumors of unrest and secretive activities have surfaced.
