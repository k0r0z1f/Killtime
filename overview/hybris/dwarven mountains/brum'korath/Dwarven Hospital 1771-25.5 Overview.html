        <!-- Detailed Breakdown -->
        <div class="section-content" id="location-name">
            <h2>Location Name</h2>
            <p>The Dwarven Hospital is a facility located in the heart of Brum'korath, a city renowned for its dwarven architecture and history. It serves as a place of healing and respite for both locals and travelers alike.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="population">
            <h2>Population</h2>
            <p>The hospital is mostly occupied by its staff, including highly skilled dwarven healers and attendants. There are a few patients, with Wallace being the most notable. His presence causes unease, as rumors swirl about his ties to dangerous factions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>The hospital is a place of functional design, with cold stone walls that give it a somber and stark atmosphere. Lighting is minimal, only provided by torches and a small fire in the corner, making the space feel dim and muted. The sparse furnishings contribute to its utilitarian nature, with little adornment aside from some practical decor.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="energy-atmosphere">
            <h2>Energy & Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>The hospital has a quiet and tense energy, with an undercurrent of suspicion. The low light and stone walls enhance this feeling, and the presence of the heavily guarded patients, particularly Wallace, adds an air of secrecy. There is a sense that not everything is as it seems within the walls.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="architecture">
            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>The architecture is simple and pragmatic, made to suit the needs of its inhabitants rather than for beauty or luxury. The stone rooms are functional, with little in the way of decoration, emphasizing practicality over aesthetics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="symbolism-carvings">
            <h2>Symbolism & Carvings</h2>
            <p>The walls are adorned with intricate carvings, showcasing the dwarven craftsmanship that is highly valued in Brum'korath. However, the carvings are not decorative but serve a more functional purpose, reflecting the hospital's focus on utility rather than ornamental beauty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="defenses">
            <h2>Defenses</h2>
            <p>The hospital is heavily guarded, both to protect its patients and to ensure that no one with malicious intent can enter. This heightened security is especially focused on Wallace, whose status has made him a figure of intrigue and suspicion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="legends-lore">
            <h2>Legends & Lore</h2>
            <p>There are rumors that Wallace has connections with the Sent Ones and the Unbound, two factions that are known to operate in the shadows. While no one has concrete proof, these whispers contribute to the tension surrounding his stay at the hospital.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="hidden-dangers">
            <h2>Hidden Dangers</h2>
            <p>The most immediate danger lies in the secrecy surrounding Wallace. His ties to dangerous factions put the hospital—and anyone connected to it—at risk. The truth of his involvement remains hidden, and the hospital’s seemingly safe atmosphere masks a deeper uncertainty.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="link-party">
            <h2>Link to the Party</h2>
            <p>The party’s connection to the Dwarven Hospital is implied through Wallace, whose presence is a focal point of suspicion. The party may eventually be drawn into the mysteries surrounding his involvement with the Sent Ones and the Unbound, setting the stage for future conflict.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="surrounding-terrain">
            <h2>Surrounding Terrain</h2>
            <p>Located within Brum'korath, the hospital is surrounded by the dense, stone-clad cityscape. The terrain is harsh and unforgiving, with cold winds that whistle through the city's high towers. The surrounding environment reflects the dwarven focus on durability and strength.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="weather">
            <h2>Weather</h2>
            <p>The weather surrounding the Dwarven Hospital is typically cool or cold, with a chill that cuts through the air, particularly in the higher reaches of Brum'korath where the hospital is situated. The city’s altitude and the mountainous surroundings contribute to its frigid conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="recent-developments">
            <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
            <p>Recent rumors have surfaced surrounding Wallace’s deeper involvement in the Sent Ones, and there are whispers that the hospital is not just a place of healing but a front for more clandestine operations. Wallace’s healing process is ongoing, but his recovery may have larger implications for the city and the factions it houses.</p>
