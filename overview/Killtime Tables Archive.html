        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Active Thoughts in the Brain</td>
            <td>Active thoughts are primarily processed in the prefrontal cortex, with support from regions like the parietal and temporal lobes and hippocampus. These areas work together for decision-making, problem-solving, and planning.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Mind-Wandering While Doing a Task</td>
            <td>When lost in thought, the default mode network (DMN) becomes active for mind-wandering and introspection, while the executive control network and dorsal attention network handle the physical task at hand.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Lucas’s Telepathy & DMN</td>
            <td>Without intense concentration, Lucas’s telepathy focuses on the target’s DMN, picking up on surface-level, wandering thoughts like daydreams or reflections.</td>

            <td>Lucas can access ambient, surface-level thoughts in the <strong>default mode network (DMN)</strong> without deep focus.</td>
            <td>Detects immediate feelings, idle thoughts, and reflections.</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2. Deeper Thought Access and Emotional Sensory Tuning</td>
            <td>Learns to delve deeper, accessing active thoughts and emotions in the <strong>prefrontal cortex</strong> and related areas.</td>
            <td>Reads complex thoughts, emotional undertones, and sensory memories.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>3. Memory Access and Short-Term Influence</td>
            <td>Gains access to <strong>stored memories</strong> and can send brief "suggestions" to subtly influence the target’s thoughts or mood.</td>
            <td>Can explore memories, create subtle emotional nudges, and influence mental states temporarily.</td>
            <td>Suggestions are subtle and temporary; deeper changes require more energy.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4. Memory Editing and Enhanced Thought Influence</td>
            <td>Can modify neural pathways related to memories, altering or obscuring certain details; has greater control over active thought and emotional influence.</td>
            <td>Edits recent memories, creates false associations, and temporarily changes mood or focus.</td>
            <td>Limited to recent memories or specific details; long-term or ingrained changes are challenging.</td>

            <td>5. Comprehensive Memory Rewriting and Full Thought Manipulation</td>
            <td>Gains control over specific <strong>neural circuits</strong> to alter memories entirely, guiding thoughts and emotions comprehensively as if scripting the person’s responses.</td>
            <td>Rewrites memories, implants or removes memories, and fully guides thoughts and emotions.</td>
            <td>Requires focus to maintain; long-term possession drains energy significantly.</td>

            <td>6. Full Neural Control and Possession</td>
            <td>Achieves full control over <strong>neural connections</strong>, allowing for permanent changes to memory, personality, and actions, and enabling possession of the person’s body and senses.</td>
            <td>Fully controls the target’s body, experiences their senses, and makes lasting changes to memories and traits.</td>
