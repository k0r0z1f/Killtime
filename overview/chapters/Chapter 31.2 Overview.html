            <h2>31.2.1 - Aftermath of the Beast</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>In the aftermath of their brutal battle with the Beast, the group assesses the damage to their shelter and tends to their injuries. The battle left the shelter in ruins, with cracks in the walls and debris littering the floor. The tension in the air is heightened by a far greater concern—Lucas and Mina have vanished without a trace. Thomas, despite his injuries, is desperate to begin searching for them, but Aphyrosia insists they focus on healing first. She provides magical healing to Thomas, Candice, and others, though it only partially restores them. Meanwhile, Dira tends to Altheris’s wound, demonstrating her practical medical skills. As the group regains their strength, the urgency to find their missing companions looms over them.</p>

            <h2>31.2.2 - Vanished Without a Trace</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>The group steps out of the shelter into a worsening storm, searching for any sign of Lucas and Mina. Thomas, filled with frustration and guilt, leads the search, but there are no footprints, no burn marks—nothing to indicate what happened. Candice suspects something erased their tracks, while Aphyrosia senses the Minulican's lingering energy. She determines that it has left the area, heading east toward the jungle. Thomas refuses to wait and insists on searching, but Aphyrosia urges patience, knowing they must think strategically. As the cold and night deepen, their search remains fruitless.</p>

            <h2>31.2.3 - The Vanishing and Return</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>As a relentless storm rages outside, the group remains restless, unable to find any sign of Lucas and Mina after their mysterious disappearance. The atmosphere in the damaged shelter is tense, with Thomas barely containing his frustration and Candice pragmatically waiting for a sign. Dira, sickened by the unnatural circumstances, struggles to process what has happened, while Aphyrosia meditates, sensing disturbances beyond their understanding. Suddenly, Candice notices a strange shimmer in the air, followed by Lucas and Mina reappearing exactly where they vanished—collapsed in the snow, unconscious but alive. The group rushes to their side, overwhelmed with relief, but their return raises more questions. Their fevers are gone, their vitals stable, yet something lingers in their minds. Aphyrosia assures the group that they will wake soon, though it is clear that something has changed.</p>
            <h3>Key Themes &amp; Moments</h3>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Unnatural Phenomenon</strong>: The strange shimmering in the air hints at forces beyond their comprehension.</li>
                <li><strong>Relief and Unease</strong>: Though the group is relieved to have Lucas and Mina back, an underlying tension remains—where had they gone, and what had happened to them?</li>
                <li><strong>Aphyrosia’s Insight</strong>: She senses something lingering in their minds, reinforcing the idea that their journey is becoming increasingly tied to forces beyond their control.</li>
