            <h2>27.3.1 - Mission Briefing: Preparing for the Eastern Continent</h2>
            <p>The party is briefed on their mission to the Eastern Continent, where they must study the Disciple of Air and prevent it from escaping. Altheris introduces the importance of the mission, while tensions rise among the party members as they discuss different strategies for handling the threat. Lucas questions why they are needed, and Candice insists on consulting the Watcher. However, Altheris dismisses the idea. Dira suggests a compromise, and the group views the Windfighter, the transport vessel for the mission. Altheris also gives Lucas access to the magi-tech lab to study his relic.</p>
