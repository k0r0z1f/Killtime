            <h2>Chapter 24.3 - Fractured Fronts (Part 3)</h2>
            <p>The group executes a daring plan to exploit the Disciple’s vulnerability, using thermal shock to weaken its rocky armor.

            <p>Wallace arrives to aid the group, providing a much-needed tactical advantage. However, the Disciple adapts to their strategy, and the battle grows increasingly difficult.

It is only when Thomas intervenes that the Disciple is truly vanquished. The city lies in ruins, and the group surveys the aftermath, dealing with the toll of the battle on both their bodies and spirits. Their journey, however, is far from over, and the future remains uncertain.</p>
