            <tr>
                <td>Stage 1: Surface Thought Reading (DMN-Focused)</td>
                <td>Lucas begins by accessing ambient thoughts without focusing deeply, essentially tapping into the target’s default mode network (DMN).</td>
                <td>Detects immediate feelings, idle thoughts, and reflections without concentrated effort.</td>
                <td>Cannot access or influence deeper, guarded thoughts or long-term memories.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Stage 2: Deeper Thought Access and Emotional Sensory Tuning</td>
                <td>With practice, Lucas learns to delve beyond surface thoughts, accessing emotions, sensory memories, and intentional (active) thoughts.</td>
                <td>He can pick up on complex thoughts, personal biases, and emotional undertones.</td>
                <td>Still lacks the power to influence or alter these thoughts and emotions.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Stage 3: Memory Access and Short-Term Influence</td>
                <td>Lucas begins accessing stored memories, navigating past experiences, and learns to send brief "suggestions," giving him subtle influence over thoughts or feelings.</td>
                <td>Can explore memories, finding connections between them, and induce small suggestions or emotional nudges.</td>
                <td>Suggestions are subtle and short-lived; deeper changes require more concentration.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Stage 4: Memory Editing and Enhanced Thought Influence</td>
                <td>Lucas gains the ability to modify certain neural pathways related to memories and exert greater influence over active thoughts.</td>
                <td>Can edit recent memories, create false associations, or manipulate thought patterns.</td>
                <td>Memory changes are limited to recent events; long-term traits remain unchanged.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Stage 5: Comprehensive Memory Rewriting and Full Thought Manipulation</td>
                <td>Lucas learns to rewire specific neural circuits, allowing for comprehensive memory editing and full thought manipulation.</td>
                <td>Can create or erase memories and script thoughts and emotional responses.</td>
                <td>Maintaining influence is energy-intensive and requires significant focus.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Stage 6: Full Neural Control and Possession</td>
                <td>At the highest level, Lucas can rewire neurons, alter memories, and take full control of a person’s motor, sensory, and cognitive functions.</td>
                <td>Full control over the person’s body and mind, with permanent changes to memories and personality possible.</td>
                <td>Full possession is intense and difficult to maintain; overuse risks Lucas's identity.</td>
