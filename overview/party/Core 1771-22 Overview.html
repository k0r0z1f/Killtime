<h2>New Information from Chapter 22.5:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lucas</strong>: No significant updates were directly added in this chapter; the details of his internal struggles and role as a potential <strong>Sent One</strong> continue to evolve.</li>
    <li><strong>Mina</strong>: The sense of unease surrounding <strong>the researcher</strong> grows stronger, as Mina's instincts about them being a potential threat to Lucas and the group are becoming more pronounced. Her <strong>role in the prophecy</strong> remains uncertain, but her internal conflict about it deepens as they advance toward the Dwarven Gates.</li>
    <li><strong>Thomas</strong>: Continues to be the grounding force, but his <strong>skepticism about the cults</strong> grows, especially in the face of the increasing tensions with the <strong>researcher</strong> and the emerging dangers surrounding them. He remains highly protective of the group.</li>
</ul>
