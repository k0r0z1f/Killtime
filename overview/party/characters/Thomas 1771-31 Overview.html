            <p>
                Leader, companion, Hero of Brum'korath, former student with athletic background, fugitive of Central Lands, now marked as an enemy of the state. He is a protective member of the climbing group, assisting with physical challenges during the ascent of the Watcher, and is responsible for caring for Lucas and Mina while acting as a defender during crises. Thomas is also a fighter, protector, and skeptical observer who catches Dira when she slips. As a member of Lucas's group, he is trained in combat and works with Lucas to unlock relics and stop the Disciple. He is described as a pragmatist with an imposing, no-nonsense attitude, and part of the climbing group aiming to reach the Watcher’s cave (also known as Candice’s group) that is now seeking Lucas and Mina.

His personality is marked by skepticism—especially regarding cult influences—and a critical view of sudden changes in his closest allies, as evidenced by his suspicion towards Lucas and Mina’s sudden behavioral shifts and his questioning of Ceylan’s actions.

            <p>
                His abilities include significant physical strength and a talent for shielding others. He wields a sword and uses a relic that transforms into a cylindrical, piston-like device with otherworldly power. This relic not only enhances his punch but also allows his arm to absorb impacts. Additionally, the relic subtly affects his morality and decision-making, creating a notable inner conflict.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="alliances">

            <p>
                Thomas is allied with multiple factions: he is a friend and travel companion of Lucas and Mina, indirectly linked with the Cult of the Sent Ones through prophecy, and connected with the Brum'korath allies. Although marked as an enemy of the state by the World Police, he remains a member of the climbing group aiming to reach the Watcher’s cave (also known as Candice’s group) that is currently seeking Lucas and Mina.

                Beneath his composed exterior, Thomas harbors inner conflict influenced by the relic. He is suspicious of the cult’s influence and uncertain about the moral implications of the war, often feeling isolated in his beliefs. This internal struggle is compounded by guilt over his decisions and the unsettling change he senses within his mind, driven by the relic’s power.

            <p>
