        <div class="section-content" id="birth-year">
            <h2>Birth Year</h2>
            <p>No birth year has been provided for Lucas. This absence of information leaves his age and generational context ambiguous, which might be intentional to add to the mystery surrounding his character.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="role-background">
            <h2>Role/Background</h2>
            <p>Lucas is a central figure whose emergence from Ceylan’s cave is steeped in mystery and prophecy. His background is rich with conflict and peril: he is linked to a cryptic prophecy and the dying seer’s words, hinting at a destiny that transcends ordinary fate. Captured by The Beast, Lucas has endured grueling battles in caverns and captivity alike, positioning him as a lone combatant wielding fire magic against overwhelming odds.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="personality-traits">
            <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
            <p>Lucas displays an extensive array of traits: he is determined and resourceful, yet anxious and desperate at times. His calm under pressure is frequently challenged by his inner conflict and exhaustion, while his quick-thinking, adaptability, and sharp mind equip him to navigate the dire circumstances he faces.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="abilities-magic">
            <h2>Abilities/Magic</h2>
            <p>Lucas’s magical repertoire includes telekinesis, pyrokinesis, and telepathy. He demonstrates exceptional control over fire—able to shape and direct flames with precision—yet his power appears diminished, suggesting an internal struggle. Additionally, his abilities are influenced by the healing magic of the vanished mansion, adding complexity to his powers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="alliances">
            <h2>Alliances/Clans/Factions</h2>
            <p>Though often seen as a solitary figure, Lucas is connected with key characters like Ceylan and Mina. He is also part of an unnamed group comprising several companions, whose collective journey and search for ancient mysteries interweave with his own fate as foretold by a cryptic prophecy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>Marked by the scars of battle, Lucas’s appearance speaks volumes of his arduous journey. He dons a coat and boots, and a distinctive wrist relic sets him apart. His torn and singed clothes, trembling hands, and unsteady posture reflect both physical wear and emotional strain accumulated from continuous confrontations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="character-arc">
            <h2>Character Arc/Goal</h2>
            <p>Lucas’s narrative is defined by a relentless struggle for survival and self-determination. Once forced into a dire confrontation with The Beast, he is driven by the need to escape captivity and reclaim his autonomy. His journey—steeped in prophecy—pushes him to master his diminishing fire power and seek deeper truths hidden within the mysteries of a vanished mansion, all while wrestling with the possibility that he may have crossed a point of no return.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="secret">
            <h2>Secret</h2>
            <p>No secret information has been provided for Lucas, leaving this aspect of his character open to interpretation or future revelation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="combat-training">
            <h2>Combat Training</h2>
            <p>Lucas is adept in combat, relying on tactical thinking and agility honed through relentless encounters. His ability to use fire as a weapon—combined with swift, calculated reactions—renders him a formidable opponent despite the toll of his arduous journey.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="inventory">
            <h2>Inventory</h2>
            <p>Lucas’s possessions are sparse but significant. His practical attire of a coat and boots, along with a notable wrist relic, not only serve essential functions in battle but also underscore his identity as a battle-worn traveler marked by mystery and strife.</p>
