        <div class="section-content" id="birth-year">
            <h2>Birth Year</h2>
            <p>Thomas was born in 1753, and he is noted as being 17 years old, according to the provided details.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="role-background">
            <h2>Role/Background</h2>
            <p>Thomas serves as a leader and companion, known as the Hero of Brum'korath. He has a background as a former student with an athletic history and is a fugitive of the Central Lands, now marked as an enemy of the state. He is a protective member of a climbing group that assists with physical challenges during the ascent of the Watcher, responsible for caring for Lucas and Mina, and acts as a defender during crises. In battle, he is a fighter, protector, and skeptical observer—once even catching Dira when she slips. His involvement spans the aftermath of a battle, an expedition investigating a cavern, and an adventure exploring a mansion. Additionally, he is part of the climbing group aiming to reach the Watcher’s cave (also known as Candice’s group), which is now seeking Lucas and Mina.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="personality-traits">
            <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
            <p>Thomas is strategic and level-headed, exhibiting a protective nature and skepticism toward cults. He remains calm, confident, and commanding while being focused, calculating, and steady. His resilience and loyalty are balanced by occasional impatience, frustration, caution, and desperation. He is also vocal, tense, weary, and unsettled, yet his curiosity and concern drive a stoic, pragmatic, and determined outlook. With a resolute and diplomatic approach, his passionate and restless side makes him sharp, authoritative, and reflective. Overall, he is observant, practical, supportive, composed, and strong—even when feeling anxious or powerless. His readiness to act sometimes borders on anger, sarcasm, and confrontation, especially when he grows suspicious of the sudden changes in Lucas and Mina, prompting him to question Ceylan’s actions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="abilities-magic">
            <h2>Abilities/Magic</h2>
            <p>The relic Thomas wields subtly affects his morality and decision-making, creating an inner conflict. He demonstrates significant physical strength and is capable of shielding others. In combat, he wields a sword and employs a relic that transforms into a cylindrical, piston-like device with otherworldly power—enhancing his punches and allowing his arm to absorb impacts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="alliances">
            <h2>Alliances/Clans/Factions</h2>
            <p>Thomas is a friend and travel companion to both Lucas and Mina. He is indirectly linked with the Cult of the Sent Ones through prophecy and aligns with Brum'korath allies, while the World Police regard him as an enemy of the state.

He supports Lucas and Mina by ensuring their survival through epic actions on the battlefield—serving as a leader during critical confrontations, including fighting the Disciple of Earth. His personal struggle with morality amid war has driven him to deliver decisive blows against his enemies. Ultimately, his goal is to safeguard his friends, uncover hidden truths, and navigate complex political and physical challenges, including combating threats like the Minulican and the Beast, all while deciphering a mysterious prophecy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="secret">
