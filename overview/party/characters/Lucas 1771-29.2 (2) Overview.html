            <h2>Population</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Lucas, 17 years old (Born 1754).</strong> Former short-time prisoner of Brum'korath, 
                he has been pulled into major conflicts across the land from an early age. He is one of the 
                Children of Hybris, marked by prophecy. Officially considered an outlaw in the Central Lands 
                after the Kingston incident, he escaped custody and has been on the run. Despite his 
                precarious status, his intellect and resolve have kept him alive.
            </p>

        <div class="section-content" id="appearance">
            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <p>
                Lucas stands at around <strong>5’10”</strong> with a lean build. He has <strong>light-brown, 
                disheveled hair</strong>, and <strong>brown eyes</strong> that often carry a serious or 
                worried look. His expressions typically reflect the stress he endures or the focus of his 
                contemplations. He often wears a <strong>worn satchel</strong> slung across his shoulder, 
                containing notes, relic information, and survival gear. His posture can be slightly guarded, 
                revealing both caution and vigilance.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="energy-atmosphere">
            <h2>Energy & Atmosphere</h2>
            <p>
                Lucas’s personality is a swirling mix of <strong>determination, analytical thinking, 
                introspection, and caution</strong>. He is curious by nature, but also deeply weighed 
                down by guilt and mistrust born from past events. He can be <strong>skeptical and 
                reserved</strong>, yet protective of those close to him. Socially, he may be shy or 
                hesitant, even easily embarrassed when it comes to romantic feelings, but his sense of 
                duty pushes him to adapt. This makes him at times <strong>anxious but hopeful</strong>, 
                gradually warming up to the group as he realizes the importance of unity.

        <div class="section-content" id="architecture">
            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                Lucas possesses a range of psychic and elemental abilities. 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Telepathy</strong>: Three stages—Surface Thought Reading, Deeper Thought 
                        Access/Emotional Sensory, and limited <em>Memory Access</em>. Permanent telepathic 
                        link with Mina.</li>
                    <li><strong>Telekinesis</strong>: Intermediate control, allowing multiple small objects 
                        or one larger object (up to ~30kg).</li>
                    <li><strong>Pyrokinesis</strong>: Basic flame creation and intermediate fire manipulation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Entry-level Clairvoyance</strong>: Unconscious or rudimentary visions, 
                        not well controlled.</li>
                </ul>
                Additionally, he demonstrates <strong>emerging mastery of arcane technology</strong>—capable 
                of communicating telepathically with the relics, and potentially unlocking deeper powers linked 
                to the prophecy.
            </p>

        <div class="section-content" id="symbolism">
            <h2>Symbolism & Carvings</h2>
            <p>
                Lucas’s affiliations are both formal and informal. He is <strong>aligned with Mina and Thomas</strong>, 
                key companions who also bear fused relics. Though an <strong>outlaw to the World Police</strong> 
                (due to misunderstandings and the Kingston incident), he also holds a <strong>temporary alliance 
                with Haliriel</strong> and has ties to <strong>the Children of Hybris</strong>. He indirectly 
                finds himself connected to the <strong>Cult of the Sent Ones</strong> through prophecy. 
                Despite these complexities, he moves forward with the mission team that aims to undertake 
                the Eastern Continent expedition.

        <div class="section-content" id="defenses">
            <h2>Defenses</h2>
            <p>
                In terms of combat, Lucas leans on his <strong>strategic thinking and psychic powers</strong>. 
                While he has <strong>basic weapon training</strong> and moderate combat experience, it is 
                his telekinesis and pyrokinesis that provide him with an edge. His time in Brum'korath and 
                the constant need to evade capture have honed his survival instincts, pushing him to 
                innovate on the fly. He is capable of leadership in tense situations, though he often feels 
                the weight of responsibility keenly.

        <div class="section-content" id="legends">
            <h2>Legends & Lore</h2>
            <p>
                Lucas is <strong>central to ancient relic prophecies</strong> as one of the 
                <em>Children of Hybris</em> and part of the <em>Sent Ones</em> prophecy. He, along 
                with Mina and Thomas, has a fused relic, linking him to the unfolding events. His involvement 
                in the Cults War and the Disciple’s rampage has placed him in a precarious spotlight. Many 
                see him as a key figure capable of unlocking the relics’ power to <strong>stop the Disciples’ 
                threat</strong>. Yet rumor and speculation persist—some believe he may be misled about being 
                “chosen,” while others think the relic’s chaotic synergy with him is a sign of deeper destiny.

        <div class="section-content" id="hidden-dangers">
            <h2>Hidden Dangers</h2>
            <p>
                The greatest hidden danger for Lucas lies in the <strong>memory of the Kingston explosion</strong> 
                and the guilt he harbors over it. Furthermore, he is burdened by an <strong>anomaly in his DNA</strong> 
                that could cause instability with the relic’s synchronization. He has deep-seated 
                <strong>mistrust of elves and dwarves</strong>, resulting from manipulations in his past, 
                and feels uncertain about how far the prophecy might push him. His experiences in 
                medical laboratories from birth to age 11 have left scars, both mental and physical, that 
                continue to influence him.

                    <li><strong>Candice</strong>: Known for 3 days, unsure but feels compelled to believe her;

                Beneath the surface, Lucas carries <strong>the lingering burdens of medical experimentation</strong> 
                that define much of his past. From infancy to age 11, he was subjected to various procedures 
                aimed at enhancing or controlling his latent abilities. This invasive history creates an 
                undercurrent of anxiety, especially regarding institutional forces like the World Police or 
                powerful factions he cannot fully trust.

            <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
            <p>
                Having <strong>recently been released from Brum'korath</strong>, Lucas is now traveling 
                to prepare for an upcoming <strong>Eastern Continent expedition</strong> intended to 
                confront the Disciple of Air. He aims to <strong>understand the nature of the relics</strong>, 
                stop the looming threat of the Disciples, and protect his companions. Uncertain political 
                motivations swirl around him, yet his main goal remains the same: to discover the truth 
                behind the relics and the prophecy, and to ensure the safety of those he cares about.
