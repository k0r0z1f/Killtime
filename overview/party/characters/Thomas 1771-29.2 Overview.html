        <!-- Detailed Breakdown (full details) -->
        <div class="section-content" id="birth-year">
            <h2>Birth Year</h2>
            <p>Thomas was born in 1753 and is currently 17 years old (as of the current date, 04-06-1771). This makes him notably young for his leadership role and current responsibilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="role-background">
            <h2>Role/Background</h2>
            <p>
                Thomas serves as a leader, companion, and the Hero of Brum'korath. Formerly a student with an athletic background, he became a fugitive of the Central Lands and is now marked as an enemy of the state. Despite these circumstances, Thomas is a critical member of Lucas’s group, trained in combat and dedicated to unlocking relics to stop the Disciple.
            </p>
            <p>
                His pragmatic nature and imposing, no-nonsense attitude make him a natural battlefield leader. He adapts quickly to unpredictable scenarios, balancing his role as a protector with the necessity of dealing decisively with threats.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="personality-traits">
            <h2>Personality Traits</h2>
            <p>
                Thomas is strategic, level-headed, and protective. He exhibits calmness, confidence, and a commanding presence. His focus and calculating mindset allow him to remain steady and resilient in the face of danger. He is loyal, yet can be impatient or frustrated when pressed. Cautious and determined, he maintains diplomatic awareness and is passionate in his pursuits. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The relic he wears makes him more overprotective of Lucas and Mina, intensifying an internal conflict between his protective instincts and his respect for his friends’ autonomy. He struggles with guilt over decisions that could harm his companions and strives to find balance.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="abilities-magic">
            <h2>Abilities/Magic</h2>
            <p>
                Thomas possesses a relic bound to his wrist which subtly affects his morality and decision-making. This connection creates inner turmoil, influencing his actions in ways that remain unknown to both himself and his allies. The magic or power of the relic is not overt but steadily amplifies his protective tendencies, potentially driving him into morally grey areas.
            </p>
        </div>

Additionally, he has allies in Brum'korath. However, Thomas and his group are declared enemies of the state by the World Police, which places him in constant danger and under surveillance.
            </p>

He plays a pivotal role in battles, serving as a battlefield leader, particularly in conflicts against the Disciple of Earth.
            </p>

                He struggles with his morality and the weight of war, ultimately delivering a final blow to end the Disciple of Earth’s threat. Thomas aims to shield his friends while helping them uncover the truth. He navigates Brum'korath’s political landscape, endures continual surveillance, and remains steadfast in the pursuit of stopping catastrophe. At the same time, he seeks to understand the prophecy that guides them, all while coping with his own shifting moral compass influenced by the relic.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-content" id="secret">
            <h2>Secret</h2>
            <p>
                Thomas harbors deep suspicion of various cults’ influence and remains uncertain about the moral implications of the ongoing war. He feels isolated in his skepticism and struggles with guilt over the impact his choices may have on his friends. Unbeknownst to him, the relic is changing his mind and reinforcing his overprotective nature, causing him to question his own judgment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mina is also a best friend to Thomas. He admires her abilities and respects her independence.
